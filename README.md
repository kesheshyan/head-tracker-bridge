# head-tracker-bridge
This is a complementary project for working with https://github.com/dlktdr/HeadTracker . At the moment the HeadTracker solution is not reading PPM input signal properly, so I had to implement this part myself. This repo will be no longer relevant with the head tracker release > 2.1
