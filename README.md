# head-tracker-bridge
This is a complementary project for working with https://github.com/dlktdr/HeadTracker . At the moment the HeadTracker solution is not reading PPM input signal properly, so I had to implement this part myself. This repo will be no longer relevant with the head tracker release > 2.1

I put together a simplified diagram how this works https://lucid.app/publicSegments/view/032e0d9f-3284-4037-a631-9cb9eaaa9a30/image.png 

The solution in this repo represents the "Magic Box" (or the bridge) part of the diagram.
